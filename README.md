# PSX_MCSX
An Edit of the PSX Minecraft shader (https://github.com/ckosmic/minecraft-psx), intended for use in the MCSX modpack.

Replicates the look of a PS1 era game in Minecraft, including chunky pixels, affine texture warping, and other fun effects.

This version of the shader pack adds the following:
- colored floodfill lighting (configurable through block.properties file)
- new sky and fog effects
- color correction
- a 2D billboarding effect on many flat geometry
- optional CRT filter effects
- waving water/lava
- renders sign text at a higher resolution for better clarity
- many other tweaks designed specifically for the MCSX modpack.

Compatible with Optifine and Iris, tested for 1.18 through 1.20.
